# Unity Enum Editor
A Serialized Enum Editor for Unity. **Requires Odin Inspector**.

## Main Features
- **Add or Remove Enum Entries with Associated Constant Values**  
  Intelligently manage enum entries directly from the editor. When adding or removing an entry, the editor ensures associated constant values are handled properly, keeping your enums consistent.

- **Auto-Detect or Specify Enum File Location**  
  The editor can automatically locate the enum file within your project. If preferred, you can manually specify the file's path to have precise control over where changes are applied.

- **Built Using Odin Inspector**  
  The editor is powered by [Odin Inspector](https://odininspector.com/), providing a highly polished and intuitive user interface for seamless integration and usage in Unity.

1. Copy or move the `EnumsEditor` folder into your Unity project's `Assets` folder.
   ```

2. Ensure you have [Odin Inspector](https://odininspector.com/) installed in your project, as it's required for this package.
